Examples
===============

This page walks through the basics of using the VectorNav Python Library with
an example for connecting to a VectorNav sensor.

1. Before getting started, please make sure you have Python v3.4 or later
   installed on your system and can run the Python interpreter from the
   command line.

2. Next you will need to make the VectorNav library accessible from the Python
   interpreter. The preferred method is to copy the appropriate package from
   ``{LIBRARY}/python/bin`` and place it under your PYTHONPATH in the
   site-packages directory. For example, on a Windows machine, you would copy
   the folder ``{LIBRARY}/python/bin/win32/vn`` and place this under the path
   ``C:/Python34/Lib/site-packages`` (typical path). The alternative method is
   to start the Python interpreter in the directory with the appropriate
   VectorNav binary package. On Windows, you would first use the command line
   to change directory to ``{LIBRARY}/python/bin/win32`` and then start the
   Python interpreter.

3. Now start the Python interpreter from the command line by executing the
   command ``python``.

4. We will now use the VectorNav Python Library to connect and interact with a
   VectorNav sensor. Import the ``vnpy.sensors`` module by executing the command
   below::
   
	>>> from vnpy.sensors import *

5. Create a new ``VnSensor`` object and connect to the sensor, substituting the
   appropriate connection parameters::
   
	>>> vs = VnSensor()
	>>> vs.connect("COM1", 115200)

6. Now let's query the sensor to get the model number. All methods that request
   and return information are formatted as ``read*`` where the asterisk is
   replaced the register's name as listed in the product's user manual,
   converted to camel case::
   
	>>> vs.read_model_number()
	'VN-200T-CR'

7. Now, let's read in some orientation data from the sensor. We will now query
   the Yaw Pitch Roll register::
   
	>>> vs.read_yaw_pitch_roll()
	<vn.math._math.vec3f object at 0x00735730>
    
   This doesn't look like the Yaw Pitch Roll data we expect from the sensor.
   What is actually displayed is information about a 3-component vector storing
   our Yaw Pitch Roll data. Let's requery the sensor but this time store the
   returned object in a variable::
   
	>>> ypr = vs.read_yaw_pitch_roll()
    
   We now have our queried Yaw Pitch Roll stored in our variable ``ypr``. You
   can access the individual components as shown below::
   
	>>> ypr.x
	76.09700012207031
	>>> ypr.y
	-31.472000122070312
	>>> ypr.z
	1.378000020980835
    
8. Most of the registers of the sensor are accessed via structured objects. The
   previous register was structured as a ``vec3f`` object representing the
   3-components of yaw, pitch and roll. More complex registers are further
   structured depending on the types of fields present. Let's see what happens
   when we query the Yaw, Pitch, Roll, Magnetic, Acceleration, and Angular
   Rates register::
   
	>>> reg = vs.read_yaw_pitch_roll_magnetic_acceleration_and_angular_rates()
    
   You can easily see the structure of the returned object by performing a
   ``dir`` on the object::
   
	>>> dir(reg)
	['__class__', '__delattr__', '__dict__', '__dir__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__form
	at__', '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__init__', '__instan
	ce_size__', '__le__', '__lt__', '__module__', '__ne__', '__new__', '__reduce__',
	 '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__setattr__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subclas
	shook__', '__weakref__', 'accel', 'gyro', 'mag', 'yawPitchRoll']
   
   The displayed listing shows a lot of built-in attributes, but at the end,
   you can see the fields ``accel``, ``gyro``, ``mag`` and ``yawPitchRoll``.
   If you try accessing the ``accel`` field, you will get the information about
   a ``vn.core.vec3f`` object, indicating this data is structured into a
   3-component vector object. To access the individual acceleration components,
   you must access them as shown below::
   
	>>> reg.accel.x
	-5.255000114440918
	>>> reg.accel.y
	-0.19300000369548798
	>>> reg.accel.z
	-8.543000221252441
    
9. Let's do a simple reconfiguration of the sensor to illustrate a write operation.
   The factory default for asynchronous data output frequency is 40 Hz. You can
   change this setting to 10 Hz by issuing the commands below.
   
	>>> vs.write_async_data_output_frequency(10)
	>>> vs.read_async_data_output_frequency()
	10
    
10. In the previous step, it is possible to send a single value to set the
    register because the register has a simple arrangement of two fields with
    the second field being optional. However, many configuration registers have
    an assortment of many fields. The preferred way to configure these
    registers is to first read the existing settings, modifying the desired
    fields in the returned object, and then sending the object to update the
    register. The commands below illustrate this sequence for the register
    VPE Basic Control::
    
	>>> reg = vs.read_vpe_basic_control()
	>>> reg.headingMode
	vn.core.HeadingMode.Relative
	>>> reg.headingMode = HeadingMode.Absolute
	>>> vs.writeVpeBasicControl(reg)
	>>> reg = vs.read_vpe_basic_control()
	>>> reg.headingMode
	vn.core.HeadingMode.Absolute
    
    This example also illustrates the use of enums for register fields that
    only accept a certain range of values.
    
    If you prefer to not do a read of the existing register values followed by
    modification of only the fields you wish to change, you can also fully
    specify the fields of the register by creating a new structure with the
    desired values. The commands below show how to set the register back to 
    its original setting::
    
	>>> reg = VpeBasicControlRegister(VpeEnable.Enable, HeadingMode.Relative, VpeMode.Mode1, VpeMode.Mode1)
	>>> vs.write_vpe_basic_control(reg)
