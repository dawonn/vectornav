Getting Started
===============

This page walks through the basics of using ``vnpy`` in a Python console to
connect and read data from a VectorNav sensor.

1. Open a terminal window and execute the command ``python`` (Windows) or
   ``python3`` (Linux).


2. Import all objects from the ``vnpy`` namespace::

    >>> from vnpy import *


3. Create a new ``VnSensor`` object and connect to the sensor, substituting the
   appropriate connection parameters::
   
    >>> s = VnSensor()
    >>> s.connect('COM1', 115200)


4. Verify connectivity with the sensor by reading the model number::

    >>> s.read_model_number()
    'VN-100T-CR'

  .. note:: All methods that read register values from the sensor start with
      `read` followed by the register's name as listed in the sensor's user
      manual.


5. Query some orientation data by reading the current values of the `Yaw Pitch Roll` register::
   
    >>> s.read_yaw_pitch_roll()
    vec3f([ -43.977, 13.571, 165.119 ])

   Individual components of the yaw, pitch, roll can be accessed from the :class:`vec3f` object.

    >>> ypr = s.read_yaw_pitch_roll()
    >>> ypr.x
    -43.917999267578125
    >>> ypr.y
    13.586000442504883
    >>> ypr.z
    165.1219940185547

    
6. Most registers are accessed using structured objects since their are usually
   many fields in the register. The previous register was structured using a
   :class:`vec3f` object that holds the 3-components of yaw, pitch and roll. More
   complex register are futher structured depending on the fields present. Let's
   see what happens when we query the Yaw, Pitch, Roll, Magnetic, Acceleration,
   and Angular Rates register::
   
    >>> reg = s.read_yaw_pitch_roll_magnetic_acceleration_and_angular_rates()
    
  You can easily see the structure of the returned object by performing a
  ``dir`` on the object::
   
    >>> dir(reg)
    ['__class__', '__del__', '__delattr__', '__dict__', '__dir__', '__doc__', '__eq_
	_', '__format__', '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__init__'
	, '__le__', '__lt__', '__module__', '__ne__', '__new__', '__reduce__', '__reduce
	_ex__', '__repr__', '__setattr__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__',
	'__swig_destroy__', '__weakref__', 'accel', 'gyro', 'mag', 'this', 'thisown', 'y
	aw_pitch_roll']
   
  The displayed listing shows a lot of built-in attributes, but at the end,
  you can see the fields ``accel``, ``gyro``, ``mag`` and ``yaw_pitch_roll``.
  Let's see what the values for ``accel`` are::
   
	>>> reg.accel
	vec3f([ 2.247, -2.36, 8.885 ])

    
7. Let's do a simple reconfiguration of the sensor to illustrate a write operation.
   The factory default for asynchronous data output frequency is 40 Hz. You can
   change this setting to 10 Hz by issuing the commands below.
   
	>>> s.write_async_data_output_frequency(10)
	>>> s.read_async_data_output_frequency()
	10
    
8. In the previous step, it is possible to send a single value to set the
   register because the register has a simple arrangement of two fields with
   the second field being optional. However, many configuration registers have
   an assortment of many fields. The preferred way to configure these
   registers is to first read the existing settings, modifying the desired
   fields in the returned object, and then sending the object to update the
   register. The commands below illustrate this sequence for the register
   VPE Basic Control::
    
	>>> reg = s.read_vpe_basic_control()
	>>> reg.heading_mode
	1
	>>> reg.heading_mode == HEADINGMODE_RELATIVE
	True
	>>> reg.heading_mode = HEADINGMODE_ABSOLUTE
	>>> s.write_vpe_basic_control(reg)
	>>> reg = s.read_vpe_basic_control()
	>>> reg.heading_mode == HEADINGMODE_ABSOLUTE
	True
    
  This example also illustrates the use of enums for register fields that
  only accept a certain range of values.
    
  If you prefer to not do a read of the existing register values followed by
  modification of only the fields you wish to change, you can also fully
  specify the fields of the register by creating a new structure with the
  desired values. The commands below show how to set the register back to 
  its original setting::
    
	>>> reg = VpeBasicControlRegister(VPEENABLE_ENABLE, HEADINGMODE_RELATIVE, VPEMODE_MODE1, VPEMODE_MODE1)
	>>> s.write_vpe_basic_control(reg)
